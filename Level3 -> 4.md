We start off the challenge by logging in as ``Leviathan3`` over ssh on Port ``2223``:

```console
ssh leviathan3@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
```

This time we have an executable called `level3`  this one also has the `SUID` bit set to run as `leviathan4`, and running the executable we are asked for a password:
```console
leviathan3@gibson:~$ ls -la
total 40
drwxr-xr-x  2 root       root        4096 Apr 10 14:23 .
drwxr-xr-x 83 root       root        4096 Apr 10 14:24 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root         220 Mar 31  2024 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root        3771 Mar 31  2024 .bashrc
-r-sr-x---  1 leviathan4 leviathan3 18100 Apr 10 14:23 level3
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root         807 Mar 31  2024 .profile

leviathan3@gibson:~$ ./level3
Enter the password> test
bzzzzzzzzap. WRONG
```

Let's have a closer look with `ltrace`:
```console
leviathan3@gibson:~$ ltrace ./level3
__libc_start_main(0x80490ed, 1, 0xffffd494, 0 <unfinished ...>
strcmp("h0no33", "kakaka")                                                                                                       = -1
printf("Enter the password> ")                                                                                                   = 20
fgets(Enter the password> test
"test\n", 256, 0xf7fae5c0)                                                                                                 = 0xffffd26c
strcmp("test\n", "snlprintf\n")                                                                                                  = 1
puts("bzzzzzzzzap. WRONG"bzzzzzzzzap. WRONG
)                                                                                                       = 19
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

WOW! This is almost too easy - once again the executable is using string-compare function (`strcmp`) to compare our input to a fixed string `snlprintf` - so that must be our password!
Having given the correct password to the executable we now have shell access (as leviathan4 thanks to the SUID bit) and we can peek into the password file:
```console
leviathan3@gibson:~$ ./level3
Enter the password> snlprintf
[You've got shell]!
$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4
